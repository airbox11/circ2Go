Welcome to circ2GO
Thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are expressed in eukaryotic cells. Here, we provide a dataset of circRNA expression for 148811 circRNAs based on 3.5 billion sequencing reads of rRNA-depleted RNA derived from 60 human lung cell lines including 50 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. Additionally, the circRNA expression data is merged with orthogonal data about gene and transcript information, functional annotation by gene ontology and microRNA binding site prediction.

In circ2GO, you can explore the circRNA profiles, visualize circRNAs expressed from each gene and differentially spliced transcript, view the gene ontology annotation and microRNA binding sites for each circRNA and download the respective data. Most importantly, reverse searches allow the search for circRNAs derived from genes with certain biological processes, molecular functions or cellular components assigned by gene ontology or possessing specific microRNA binding sites to discover circRNAs in the areas of your interest.
